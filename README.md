# CMP325-FibonacciTest
Fibonacci Sequence Generator and Tester
This repository contains a Java program for generating the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence and a corresponding test class to ensure the correctness of the generator using JUnit.

Test Result:
![FibTest](https://github.com/samuelolubukun/CMP325-FibonacciTest/assets/132141300/a3ccc676-279c-4563-aa23-7652ea617efe)

What it does:
Fib.java: This class generates the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence and stores them in an array.
FibTest.java: The JUnit test class verifies that the generated sequence matches the expected sequence.

Example Expected Sequence:
[0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]

Usage:
Clone this repository.
Run the tests to generate and validate the Fibonacci sequence.

Dependencies:
Java
JUnit
